# madparts-library
This is a library of footprints for EDA. The footprints are created with [madparts](https://github.com/andete/madparts).

The footprints are mostly for my private projects and are provided as is. You have to check yourself, whether they are correct.

The library is structured into subfolders.

## export to KiCAD
TODO: write a nice script that exports to my standard library positions or maybe even to github.
